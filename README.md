# 16-bit-CORDIC-computer

Design and implement a 16-bit CORDIC computer. The design to be implemented is based on a bit-serial configuration. It will take as input a 16-bit signed binary fixed point number, corresponding to an angle in the range 0 to  Ï€/2, and use the CORDIC method to find the sine and cosine of this angle. This will be coded in Verilog and implemented on the Basys 3 board.
